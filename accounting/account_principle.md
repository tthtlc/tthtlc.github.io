Yes, in **traditional accounting systems**, once a transaction has been **posted** to the ledger, it **cannot be changed** directly. This rule ensures **data integrity, auditability, and compliance** with accounting standards. However, there are **ways to correct errors** while maintaining an accurate audit trail.  

### **Why Posted Transactions Cannot Be Changed**
1. **Audit Trail Requirement** â€“ Modifying a posted entry would compromise the ability to trace transactions for audits.  
2. **Fraud Prevention** â€“ Prevents unauthorized alterations to financial records.  
3. **Legal & Compliance Regulations** â€“ Laws such as **GAAP, IFRS, SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and tax regulations** require strict controls over financial records.  
4. **Matching Principle** â€“ Ensures that expenses and revenues remain aligned in the correct periods.  
5. **Historical Accuracy** â€“ Keeps past financial statements unchanged and reliable for future reference.  

### **How Errors in Posted Entries Are Corrected**
Since direct modification is not allowed, errors in posted entries are corrected using one of the following methods:  

#### **1. Reversal Entry (Storno Method)**
   - Create an opposite entry to nullify the effect of the incorrect transaction.  
   - Example:  
     - Wrong Entry: **Dr. Supplies Expense $500 | Cr. Cash $500**  
     - Reversal Entry: **Dr. Cash $500 | Cr. Supplies Expense $500**  
     - Then, a new correct entry is posted.  

#### **2. Adjusting Journal Entry (Correction via Adjustments)**
   - If an error affects revenue or expenses, an adjusting entry is made in the next period.  
   - Used for **accruals, deferrals, and reclassification errors**.  

#### **3. Additional Entry (Error Rectification without Reversal)**
   - Instead of reversing, a new entry is posted to correct the previous mistake.  
   - Example: If **$1,000 was incorrectly recorded as $100**, an additional entry of **$900** is posted.  

### **Exceptions in Digital Accounting Systems**
Some modern **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and Accounting Software** (e.g., SAP, QuickBooks, Oracle NetSuite) may allow **"editable periods"**, but changes are logged, requiring approval and maintaining an **audit log**.  

### **Conclusion**
Once a transaction is posted in **manual and traditional accounting systems**, it **cannot be edited or deleted**. Corrections must be made through **reversals or adjustments** to maintain **legal and audit compliance**. However, modern systems may allow **controlled modifications** while keeping a detailed log for audit trails.
