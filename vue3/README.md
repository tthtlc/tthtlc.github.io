### How to Approach These Projects:
1. Start simple with the **Composition API** for better modularity.
2. Use **Pinia** for state management to replace Vuex.
3. Explore Vue Router for dynamic navigation and nested routing.
4. Practice integrating third-party libraries like `chart.js` or `axios`.
5. Ensure responsive design with CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Vuetify.
