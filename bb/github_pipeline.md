Running pipelines as an arbitrary user via scheduled security scan policies in GitHub or GitLab involves creating schedules for pipeline execution, ensuring they run with specific permissions. Below is how to achieve this via their respective web UIs and command-line tools.

---

### **GitHub Actions:**

#### **Via Web UI:**

1. **Create a Scheduled Workflow**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Navigate to **Settings > Security** and ensure you have security scanning enabled (e.g., Dependabot alerts or CodeQL analysis).
   - In the repository root, create or modify the `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` file:
     ```yaml
     name: Security Scan

     on:
       schedule:
         - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Adjust cron for desired schedule (daily at midnight here)

     jobs:
       security_scan:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - name: Checkout code
             uses: actions/checkout@v3

           - name: Run security scanner
             run: your-security-scan-tool
     ```
   - Commit and push this file to the `main` branch.

2. **Specify the Pipeline Runner Permissions**:
   - In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Actions > General**.
   - Set the appropriate runner permissions for the pipeline. If running as an organization or team, configure workflow permissions accordingly.

3. **Verify Scheduled Runs**:
   - Navigate to **Actions** > **Security Scan Workflow** to confirm upcoming scheduled runs.

#### **Via GitHub CLI**:

1. **Install GitHub CLI**:
   - Follow the [GitHub CLI installation guide](https://cli.github.com/).

2. **Trigger the Workflow**:
   - Use the `gh` command to interact with workflows.
   - To manually trigger a security scan workflow as an arbitrary user:
     ```bash
     gh workflow run security-scan.yml
     ```
   - Schedule workflows directly via the `gh` command by editing the YAML file locally and pushing changes.

### **GitLab CI/CD:**

#### **Via Web UI:**

1. **Create a Scheduled Pipeline**:
   - Go to your GitLab project.
   - Navigate to **CI/CD > Schedules**.
   - Click **New schedule**.
   - Fill in the **Description** (e.g., "Daily Security Scan").
   - Set the **Cron** schedule (e.g., `0 0 * * *` for daily).
   - Select the **Pipeline** you want to run.

2. **Run Pipeline as Arbitrary User**:
   - Add a user token in **Settings > CI/CD > Variables** if specific user permissions are needed.
   - Use a script in `.gitlab-ci.yml` that includes scanning tools or predefined security jobs:
     ```yaml
     security_scan:
       stage: test
       script:
         - run-your-security-tool
     ```

#### **Via GitLab CLI**:

1. **Install GitLab CLI**:
   - Use the `glab` tool ([GitLab CLI documentation](https://glab.readthedocs.io/)).

2. **Trigger Scheduled Runs**:
   - Use the CLI to manually or programmatically configure and trigger pipelines:
     ```bash
     glab pipeline run --ref main
     ```
   - Combine with a cron job or CI tool to schedule these runs.

### **Key Considerations**:

- **Permissions**:
  - Ensure proper role-based permissions (e.g., tokens or user impersonation).
  - For GitLab, consider service accounts or personal access tokens tied to specific users.
  - For GitHub, workflows typically inherit permissions from the repository settings.

- **Secure Secrets**:
  - Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys) securely in **Secrets** (GitHub) or **CI/CD Variables** (GitLab).

- **Audit**:
  - Regularly review audit logs for security pipeline triggers, especially when impersonating users or running as a specific account.
