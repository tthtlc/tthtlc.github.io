Web applications are exposed to a wide range of threats due to their internet-facing nature. Understanding **threat models** helps identify and mitigate potential risks effectively. Below are common threat models categorized based on their nature, targets, and potential impacts:

---

### **1. Network-Based Threat Models**
These threats exploit vulnerabilities in the communication between the client, server, or intermediate entities.

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Attackers intercept and manipulate communication.
  - Examples: SSL stripping, packet sniffing.
- **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks**: Overwhelms a web application with traffic, making it unavailable to users.
- **DNS Spoofing/Poisoning**: Redirects users to malicious websites.
- **IP Spoofing**: Fakes IP addresses to bypass access controls.

---

### **2. Injection Attacks**
Inject malicious input into web applications to manipulate their execution.

- **SQL Injection**: Inject SQL queries to manipulate or retrieve sensitive data.
- **Command Injection**: Execute arbitrary commands on the host server.
- **NoSQL Injection**: Targets NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
- **LDAP Injection**: Manipulates LDAP queries to gain unauthorized access.

---

### **3. Cross-Site Attacks**
These target user interactions or manipulate browser behavior.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
  - Types: Stored, Reflected, DOM-based.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Tricks authenticated users into executing unwanted actions on a web application.

---

### **4. Authentication and Authorization Threat Models**
Focus on bypassing or exploiting access control mechanisms.

- **Credential Stuffing**: Using leaked credentials from one system to access another.
- **Session Hijacking**: Stealing session cookies to impersonate a user.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining unauthorized privileges within an application.
  - Types: Vertical (user to admin) or Horizontal (user to another user).

---

### **5. Application Logic Flaws**
Exploits weaknesses in application workflows.

- **Business Logic Abuse**: Manipulates application workflows to gain unauthorized benefits.
  - Example: Exploiting discount calculations.
- **Race Conditions**: Exploits timing issues in multi-threaded applications.
  - Example: Double-spending attacks.

---

### **6. File and Resource Threats**
Targets how applications handle files and resources.

- **File Upload Vulnerabilities**: Uploading malicious files, such as scripts or executables.
- **Path Traversal**: Accesses unintended files on the server.
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: Accesses resources by directly manipulating URLs or object IDs.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Forces servers to make unauthorized requests to internal systems or third parties.

---

### **7. Configuration and Deployment Threat Models**
These arise from improper configuration or poor deployment practices.

- **Unsecured APIs**: Exploiting APIs without proper authentication or rate limiting.
- **Misconfigured Servers**: Publicly exposing sensitive directories or files (e.g., `.git` folders, logs).
- **Unencrypted Communications**: Using plaintext protocols like HTTP instead of HTTPS.
- **Third-Party Component Vulnerabilities**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in frameworks, libraries, or plugins.

---

### **8. Client-Side Threat Models**
Focus on the end user's browser or system.

- **Clickjacking**: Embeds the web application into an invisible iframe to trick users into clicking malicious elements.
- **Browser Fingerprinting**: Tracks users without their consent using device characteristics.
- **Local Storage Exploits**: Stealing sensitive data stored in the browser's local storage.

---

### **9. Insider Threats**
Risk posed by users with legitimate access.

- **Data Exfiltration**: Downloading sensitive data intentionally or unintentionally.
- **Misuse of Privileged Accounts**: Abusing admin accounts to bypass security controls.

---

### **10. Supply Chain Threats**
Exploits third-party components or dependencies.

- **Dependency Hijacking**: Inserting malicious code into open-source libraries or dependencies.
- **CDN Attacks**: Compromising content delivery networks to serve malicious scripts.

---

### **11. Cryptographic Threat Models**
Focus on weaknesses in cryptographic mechanisms.

- **Weak Password Storage**: Using weak hashing algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1 for password storage.
- **Insecure Token Generation**: Using predictable random number generators for tokens.
- **Broken Authentication**: Exploiting poorly implemented cryptographic protocols.

---

### **12. API-Specific Threat Models**
APIs are integral to modern web apps and come with their unique risks.

- **Over-Exposed Endpoints**: Exposing internal data through poorly secured endpoints.
- **Broken Object-Level Authorization**: Exploiting API endpoints to manipulate resources.
- **Mass Assignment**: Automatically binding input data to model attributes without validation.

---

### **13. Social Engineering Threat Models**
Leverage human behavior to gain unauthorized access.

- **Phishing**: Trick users into revealing credentials or sensitive information.
- **Pretexting**: Posing as someone trustworthy to gather data.

---

### **14. Emerging Threat Models**
As technology evolves, so do threats.

- **AI-Powered Attacks**: Using AI to bypass CAPTCHA or craft more convincing phishing attacks.
- **Cloud-Specific Threats**: Exploiting misconfigured cloud storage or IAM policies.
- **Cryptojacking**: Embedding cryptocurrency miners in the application to exploit client resources.

---

### **15. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**
Long-term, targeted attacks often involving multiple phases:
- Initial compromise (e.g., spear-phishing).
- Lateral movement within systems.
- Exfiltration or sabotage.

---

### Tools for Mitigating Threat Models
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Tools like SonarQube or Fortify.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP.
- **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)**: Tools to monitor runtime behavior.
- **Threat Modeling Frameworks**: STRIDE, LINDDUN, PASTA.

Each web application requires a tailored threat model based on its architecture, data sensitivity, and business logic.
