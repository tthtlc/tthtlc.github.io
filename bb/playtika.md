Welcome to the Playtika Bug Bounty Program! We now use a pay per vulnerability model and utilize the HackerOne platform!

Our rewards are based on severity per CVSS (the Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard). The table above represents the maximum bounty for each severity. 

Our rewards system is based on the game's tiers.
See below the rewards table per game tier:

Tier        |       Critical         |High                          | Medium                         | Low |

  * With a demonstrated impact that involves potential PII leakage or account takeover via a 1-click attack - will be treated in the low range of high-severity issues.
* Business logic vulnerabilities for tier 3 games, Best Fiends, June's Journey, and Solitaire Grand Harvest are out of scope.
* All domains that are associated with a game will be rewarded in accordance with their tier.
