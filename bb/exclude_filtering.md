After enumerating subdomains with tools like **Amass** or **Sublist3r**, you can use filtering tools or scripting techniques to exclude known domain names from your results. Here's a step-by-step guide and some tools you can use:

---

### **1. Use `grep` and `diff` for Filtering**
You can use simple Unix tools to filter the results against a known list of domains.

#### **Steps:**
- **File Preparation:**
  - Save the enumerated subdomains in a file, e.g., `all_subdomains.txt`.
  - Save the known list of domains to exclude in a file, e.g., `exclude_list.txt`.

- **Command:**
  ```bash
  grep -vFf exclude_list.txt all_subdomains.txt > filtered_subdomains.txt
  ```

#### **Explanation:**
- `-v`: Invert match to exclude lines from `all_subdomains.txt` that match any line in `exclude_list.txt`.
- `-F`: Use fixed-string matching.
- `-f`: Read patterns from the file `exclude_list.txt`.

---

### **2. Use Python for Custom Filtering**
Python provides flexibility to handle larger datasets or perform advanced filtering.

#### **Script:**
```python
# Load subdomains and exclusion list
with open("all_subdomains.txt", "r") as f:
    all_subdomains = set(f.read().splitlines())

with open("exclude_list.txt", "r") as f:
    exclude_list = set(f.read().splitlines())

# Filter out unwanted subdomains
filtered_subdomains = all_subdomains - exclude_list

# Save the result
with open("filtered_subdomains.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("\n".join(sorted(filtered_subdomains)))
```

---

### **3. Use Tools Built for DNS and Subdomain Operations**

#### **a. `dnsx`**
[dnsx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx) by ProjectDiscovery can handle domain filtering and resolution.

**Usage:**
- Exclude subdomains:
  ```bash
  dnsx -l all_subdomains.txt -silent | grep -vFf exclude_list.txt > filtered_subdomains.txt
  ```

#### **b. `jq` for JSON Results**
If the results are in JSON format (e.g., from **Amass**):
```bash
jq -r '.[] | select(.name as $name | $name | in({"exclude_list":[...]|from_entries})) | .name' all_subdomains.json
```

#### **c. `httprobe`**
For subdomains that resolve to live hosts:
```bash
cat all_subdomains.txt | grep -vFf exclude_list.txt | httprobe > live_filtered_subdomains.txt
```

---

### **4. Workflow Integration in Amass**
Amass itself supports filtering using configuration files or command-line options:
```bash
amass db -d example.com -show | grep -vFf exclude_list.txt > filtered_subdomains.txt
```

---

### **5. Custom Solutions with Tools Like `awk`**
For additional control:
```bash
awk 'NR==FNR{exclude[$1]; next} !($1 in exclude)' exclude_list.txt all_subdomains.txt > filtered_subdomains.txt
```

---

### Final Note:
Automating this filtering step can be integrated into your workflow using tools like **Bash**, **Python**, or custom scripts. If you're using platforms like **Recon-ng** or **OWASP Amass**, these can often handle exclusions with custom scripts or pre-processing steps.
