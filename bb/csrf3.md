When investigating CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerabilities in scenarios involving **authentication** and **invitation by email** in web applications, it’s important to consider the wide array of potential flaws that can lead to exploitation. Below is a detailed list of 30 possible scenarios where CSRF vulnerabilities could occur:

---

### **Authentication Scenarios**
1. **Session Fixation CSRF**: The application doesn't validate session IDs properly, allowing an attacker to force a victim into a session controlled by the attacker via a forged request.
2. **CSRF in Login Forms**: A lack of CSRF tokens in login forms can let an attacker submit login credentials from the victim’s session.
3. **Auto-login Features**: Auto-login or “remember me” features implemented insecurely may allow token reuse via CSRF attacks.
4. **Logout CSRF**: An attacker forces a user to logout, disrupting their session and possibly tricking them into logging in on a phishing page.
5. **Password Change CSRF**: Missing or improperly implemented CSRF protections on password change forms allow attackers to update user passwords without consent.
6. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Disabling**: If disabling 2FA lacks CSRF protection, an attacker can disable it on behalf of the victim.
7. **CSRF in OAuth Grant Requests**: An attacker can hijack OAuth flow by forcing a user to authorize an attacker-controlled app.
8. **CSRF in Social Media Login**: Exploiting "Login with X" features by forcing the victim to log in to an attacker's account.
9. **CSRF in Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Improper CSRF protection during SSO authentication or user linking can allow account compromise.
10. **Email-based Login Links**: If login links sent via email lack proper protections, attackers can trick users into authenticating on malicious accounts.
11. **API Token Generation**: API tokens generated via endpoints without CSRF protection can be issued to attackers.
12. **Account Deletion CSRF**: An endpoint to delete user accounts is vulnerable without CSRF protection.
13. **Switch User CSRF**: If "Switch User" features (for admins) lack CSRF protection, attackers can switch to admin accounts.
14. **Role Escalation CSRF**: An attacker can change a victim's role (e.g., upgrade to admin) through forged requests.
15. **Session Termination CSRF**: A request that terminates all sessions (e.g., logout everywhere) lacks CSRF protection.

### **Invitation by Email Scenarios**
16. **CSRF in Invitation Email Sending**: Missing CSRF tokens in the endpoint to send invitation emails allows an attacker to spam or invite themselves.
17. **CSRF in Invitation Acceptance**: Attackers force a victim to accept an invitation, granting the attacker unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
18. **Invitation Role Assignment**: Attackers abuse CSRF to manipulate roles assigned during the invitation acceptance process.
19. **CSRF in Invitation Resending**: The endpoint to resend invitations lacks CSRF protection, enabling email spamming.
20. **Invitation Deletion CSRF**: Attackers delete existing invitations via CSRF attacks.
21. **Inviting External Users**: Attackers exploit CSRF to invite unauthorized users to restricted systems.
22. **Changing Invitation Email Address**: Attackers modify the email address of the invited user to one they control.
23. **Invitation Approval CSRF**: Exploiting endpoints that approve pending invitations.
24. **Invitation Revocation CSRF**: Exploiting endpoints to revoke valid invitations.
25. **Invitation with Malicious Links**: Forged requests include attacker-controlled links in invitation emails.
26. **CSRF in Bulk Invitations**: Attackers exploit batch-processing endpoints to send multiple unauthorized invitations.
27. **Invitation Ownership Transfer CSRF**: Exploiting functionality to transfer invitation ownership to a different user.
28. **Overwriting Invitation Metadata**: An attacker forces updates to invitation metadata (e.g., expiration date) via forged requests.
29. **Abusing Self-Invitation Features**: If users can invite themselves, attackers can exploit CSRF to invite themselves into sensitive roles.
30. **Exploiting Default Invitation Actions**: Applications that automatically accept or execute certain actions upon invitation receipt may be CSRF-exploitable.

### **Common Patterns Leading to CSRF**
- **Insufficient CSRF Tokens**: Endpoints that handle sensitive actions lack CSRF tokens or have poorly implemented ones.
- **SameSite Cookie Misconfiguration**: Cookies are improperly set, allowing attackers to send requests with authenticated cookies.
- **Missing Origin/Referer Validation**: Servers fail to validate the `Origin` or `Referer` headers.
- **Excessive Trust in POST/GET Methods**: Incorrect assumption that certain HTTP methods are inherently safe.
- **Lack of CORS Restrictions**: Insecure CORS configurations permit CSRF in cross-origin contexts.
- **No Rate Limiting**: Lack of rate limiting amplifies CSRF exploitation through automated tools.
- **Persistent Sessions**: Long-lived session cookies increase the window of CSRF exploitation.

By investigating the application code and endpoint behavior for these scenarios, vulnerabilities can be identified and mitigated, strengthening the application's overall security posture.
