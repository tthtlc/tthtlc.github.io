**Web Cache Poisoning** is a vulnerability that leverages caching mechanisms to serve malicious or unexpected content to users. Detecting such vulnerabilities often involves identifying exploitable parameters and analyzing how caching systems handle HTTP requests and responses. Several tools and Burp Suite extensions are tailored for identifying web cache poisoning vulnerabilities:

---

### **1. Burp Suite Extensions**
These extensions integrate seamlessly with Burp Suite to enhance its capabilities for detecting cache-related issues:

#### **Param Miner**
- **Purpose**: Identifies hidden and unlinked HTTP parameters.
- **Relevance**: Helps find cache key injection points by discovering parameters that affect caching behavior.
- **Usage**: 
  - Use it to uncover parameters that may influence cache behavior.
  - Test those parameters for cache poisoning vulnerabilities.

#### **Turbo Intruder**
- **Purpose**: Conducts high-speed, customizable brute-forcing of HTTP requests.
- **Relevance**: Useful for testing multiple payloads or headers against a caching mechanism.
- **Usage**: 
  - Send repeated requests with variations in headers and payloads to observe caching inconsistencies.

#### **Cache Buster**
- **Purpose**: Helps analyze how caching mechanisms treat specific headers and parameters.
- **Relevance**: Identifies headers or query parameters that might influence cache behavior.
- **Usage**: 
  - Detect cache key variations or bypasses, which could lead to poisoning.

#### **Logger++**
- **Purpose**: Provides advanced logging capabilities for HTTP requests and responses.
- **Relevance**: Tracks subtle changes in server responses when testing for cache poisoning.
- **Usage**: 
  - Log and compare request/response pairs to identify anomalies that may suggest improper caching.

#### **Collaborator Everywhere**
- **Purpose**: Injects payloads using Burp Collaborator to detect external interactions.
- **Relevance**: Can identify cases where cache poisoning payloads trigger malicious actions on victim requests.
- **Usage**: 
  - Use it to test for behavior where cached malicious content interacts with external systems.

#### **Hackvertor**
- **Purpose**: Automates encoding and transformation of payloads.
- **Relevance**: Facilitates the crafting of encoded cache-poisoning payloads.
- **Usage**: 
  - Use it to encode or obfuscate cache-poisoning payloads for bypassing filters.

### **2. Dedicated Web Cache Poisoning Tools**
These tools are built explicitly for analyzing web cache behaviors and identifying vulnerabilities:

#### **Smuggler**
- **Purpose**: Detects HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities.
- **Relevance**: Request smuggling can lead to cache poisoning in misconfigured servers.
- **Usage**: 
  - Analyze how servers process requests to identify smuggling vectors that may enable poisoning.

#### **Cache Snooper**
- **Purpose**: Tests cache behaviors by injecting unique values into requests.
- **Relevance**: Identifies inconsistencies in how requests are cached.
- **Usage**: 
  - Inject and detect cache-affecting headers like `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Original-URL`, etc.

#### **Fuzz Faster U Fool (FFUF)**
- **Purpose**: High-speed fuzzing of HTTP parameters.
- **Relevance**: Useful for identifying parameters affecting cache behavior.
- **Usage**: 
  - Fuzz query parameters or headers to identify exploitable inputs for poisoning.

### **3. Manual Techniques Supported by Burp Suite**
While extensions and tools are helpful, manual techniques often complement them:

- **Analyze Cache-Control and Pragma Headers**: Look for improper directives like `Cache-Control: public` or missing `no-cache`/`private` headers.
- **Modify Host Headers**: Test cache behavior by injecting unexpected `Host` header values.
- **Inject Unique Payloads**: Use identifiable payloads in parameters, headers, or paths to observe cached responses.
- **Monitor Response Variations**: Use Burp's **Comparer** tool to detect differences between expected and cached responses.

### **4. Supplementary Tools for Web Cache Analysis**
- **OWASP ZAP**: Includes cache-related plugins for analyzing headers and response behaviors.
- **Wfuzz**: Useful for fuzzing headers, parameters, or paths for caching anomalies.
- **CURL or Python Requests**: For crafting and automating custom HTTP requests to test cache poisoning scenarios.

---

### **Key Headers and Parameters to Test**
- `X-Forwarded-For`
- `X-Forwarded-Host`
- `X-Original-URL`
- `X-Rewrite-URL`
- `Via`
- `Forwarded`
- `Range`
- Custom or hidden parameters.

By combining Burp Suite with these extensions and tools, along with manual testing, you can effectively detect and exploit web cache poisoning vulnerabilities.
