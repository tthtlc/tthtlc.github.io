When doing bug bounty hunting on a website, it's essential to follow a structured methodology to uncover vulnerabilities systematically. Below are the top 20 tasks:

### **1. Reconnaissance**
   - Gather subdomains using tools like `Sublist3r`, `Amass`, or `Assetfinder`.
   - Identify IP addresses, WHOIS information, and associated network ranges.
   - Search for related assets using certificates (`crt.sh`) or search engines (`Google Dorks`).

### **2. Subdomain Enumeration**
   - Check for live subdomains by performing DNS resolution or HTTP requests.
   - Use brute-forcing and permutation tools like `dnsprobe` and `dnscan`.

### **3. Directory and File Discovery**
   - Use tools like `dirsearch`, `gobuster`, or `feroxbuster` to find hidden directories and files.
   - Look for sensitive files like `.env`, `config`, `.git`, and backup files (`.bak`, `.old`).

### **4. Identifying Vulnerable Endpoints**
   - Analyze JavaScript files to discover endpoints, API keys, and credentials.
   - Look for outdated libraries or frameworks that might contain vulnerabilities.

### **5. Parameter Discovery**
   - Use tools like `Arjun` to enumerate GET and POST parameters.
   - Test endpoints with common parameters to see if they accept user inputs.

### **6. Testing for Broken Access Control**
   - Check if restricted areas are accessible without proper authentication.
   - Test IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) by manipulating object identifiers (e.g., IDs).

### **7. Input Validation Testing**
   - Test for injection vulnerabilities:
     - SQL Injection (use payloads or tools like `sqlmap`).
     - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) using various payloads.
     - Command Injection or OS Injection.

### **8. Session and Authentication Testing**
   - Look for weak session tokens, missing secure flags, or insecure storage.
   - Test for vulnerabilities in login flows:
     - Password brute-forcing.
     - No account lockout.
     - Weak or hardcoded credentials.

### **9. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - Check for missing anti-CSRF tokens on sensitive forms.
   - Attempt unauthorized actions using crafted requests.

### **10. API Security Testing**
   - Enumerate API endpoints and test for authentication and authorization flaws.
   - Check for rate-limiting issues or misconfigured CORS policies.

### **11. File Upload Functionality**
   - Test for unrestricted file uploads (e.g., PHP or JavaScript files).
   - Check if uploaded files are validated and sanitized.

### **12. Business Logic Testing**
   - Test for logical flaws in workflows (e.g., bypassing payment gateways or misusing discounts).
   - Look for unconventional attack vectors based on site-specific logic.

### **13. Security Header Validation**
   - Analyze HTTP response headers for missing or weak settings (e.g., `CSP`, `HSTS`, `X-Frame-Options`).
   - Use tools like `securityheaders.com`.

### **14. Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities**
   - Identify outdated software versions (e.g., CMS like WordPress, Drupal).
   - Use public CVEs and exploits for outdated components.

### **15. Privilege Escalation**
   - Test for vertical and horizontal privilege escalation.
   - Attempt to access admin or other high-privilege resources from a low-privilege account.

### **16. Third-Party Integrations**
   - Look for vulnerabilities in third-party tools or services integrated into the website.
   - Analyze OAuth, SSO, or payment gateway implementations.

### **17. Testing for Data Exposure**
   - Search for sensitive data leaks in the responses (e.g., API keys, credentials).
   - Analyze caching mechanisms (e.g., improperly cached responses).

### **18. Rate Limiting and DoS**
   - Check if the site is vulnerable to brute-forcing or denial-of-service attacks.
   - Exploit rate-limiting bypass techniques like IP rotation.

### **19. Social Engineering Opportunities**
   - Investigate for phishing opportunities by exploiting lookalike domains.
   - Test if error messages leak sensitive information (e.g., stack traces).

### **20. Reporting and Documentation**
   - Document all findings with detailed proof-of-concept (PoC).
   - Provide clear reproduction steps, severity ratings, and potential mitigations.

By following these steps, you can systematically approach a bug bounty program and maximize the likelihood of discovering valid and impactful vulnerabilities. Always adhere to the rules of engagement (scope, testing limitations, etc.) outlined in the program.
