Here are real-world scenarios and references for some of the identified CSRF vulnerabilities, particularly those related to authentication and email invitation systems:

### 1. **Session Hijacking through CSRF**
   - Attackers can exploit predictable session tokens to perform CSRF attacks. For instance, the "Samy Worm" exploited MySpace by executing CSRF payloads within user profiles to hijack sessions【11】.

### 2. **Manipulation of Email Invitations**
   - In a scenario involving a corporate email invitation system, attackers used CSRF to alter the recipient's email address. By embedding a malicious form on an external website, they redirected invitations to attacker-controlled emails【12】.

### 3. **GET-based CSRF Exploits**
   - A classic example is the GET request vulnerability in financial systems. Attackers used image tags or links to execute GET requests that initiated fund transfers, as seen in a banking CSRF vulnerability where attacker-crafted URLs caused unauthorized transactions【11】【12】.

### 4. **Hidden Form Exploits**
   - Attackers often embed hidden forms in external websites. In one case, a hidden form with preset values automatically submitted via JavaScript caused a user's authenticated browser session to execute unintended POST requests【12】.

### 5. **CSRF Tokens Mismanagement**
   - Improper implementation of CSRF tokens can leave systems vulnerable. For example, if tokens are stored insecurely in cookies or fail to validate server-side, attackers can reuse tokens from their own accounts to bypass protections【11】【12】.

### 6. **Weaknesses in Multi-step Processes**
   - Multi-step actions are not inherently CSRF-proof. An attacker can mimic and automate these steps. For example, a system requiring multiple interactions for sensitive actions was compromised because the CSRF exploit replicated the sequence【11】.

### 7. **Using Insecure Referrer Headers**
   - Applications relying on referrer headers for CSRF defense faced issues when attackers spoofed headers or took advantage of scenarios where the headers were null, such as when using bookmarks or privacy-focused browsers【11】.

### 8. **Cross-Origin Vulnerabilities**
   - In one case, attackers exploited permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to bypass CSRF defenses, allowing unauthorized execution of API requests on behalf of authenticated users【12】.

### 9. **Email Invitation Spoofing**
   - Systems with insufficient validation allowed attackers to use CSRF to send invitations to arbitrary emails. This issue arose in platforms where the "to" address was not validated server-side【12】.

### 10. **Cookie Overwriting in Double-Submit Patterns**
   - When using the double-submit cookie pattern, attackers exploited subdomain control to set anti-CSRF cookies, effectively bypassing the system’s CSRF defenses【12】.

Each of these vulnerabilities highlights the critical importance of robust CSRF prevention measures, such as implementing securely generated and validated CSRF tokens, avoiding predictable parameters, and ensuring server-side validation of all user inputs.
