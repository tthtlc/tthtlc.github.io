Hereâ€™s a list of 30 common attack surfaces in web applications that bug bounty hunters often explore:

### Authentication and Authorization
1. **Weak Password Policies**: Poor password requirements or lack of multi-factor authentication.
2. **Brute Force Attacks**: Insufficient rate-limiting or account lockout mechanisms.
3. **Session Hijacking**: Exposed or insecure session tokens.
4. **Broken Access Controls**: Failure to enforce proper user roles and permissions.
5. **OAuth/OpenID Vulnerabilities**: Misconfigurations or insecure implementations.
6. **JWT Vulnerabilities**: Weak signing algorithms or poorly protected tokens.
7. **Credential Stuffing**: Exploiting leaked username-password pairs.

### Input Validation
8. **SQL Injection**: Exploiting improper sanitization of SQL queries.
9. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Persistent, reflected, or DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.
10. **Command Injection**: Arbitrary command execution on the server.
11. **Server-Side Template Injection**: Execution of malicious templates.
12. **File Upload Vulnerabilities**: Allowing execution of uploaded files without validation.
13. **Path Traversal**: Unauthorized access to files via manipulated paths.
14. **CRLF Injection**: Exploiting improper handling of newlines in HTTP headers.

### Security Misconfigurations
15. **Unrestricted Admin Panels**: Admin panels accessible to unauthorized users.
16. **Exposed Sensitive Files**: `.env`, `.git`, or backup files publicly accessible.
17. **Improper Error Handling**: Error messages revealing sensitive information.
18. **CORS Misconfigurations**: Allowing unauthorized origins to make requests.
19. **Directory Listing**: Exposing the contents of directories.
20. **Default Credentials**: Using factory-set usernames and passwords.

### Business Logic
21. **Logic Flaws**: Circumventing application workflows or restrictions (e.g., bypassing payment).
22. **Mass Assignment**: Exploiting improperly guarded object properties.

### APIs and Web Services
23. **API Key Exposure**: Hardcoded or leaked API keys.
24. **Insecure API Endpoints**: Lack of proper authentication, authorization, or input validation.
25. **GraphQL Vulnerabilities**: Excessive data exposure or introspection enabled.

### Client-Side Vulnerabilities
26. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Exploiting missing or weak anti-CSRF tokens.
27. **Clickjacking**: UI redressing attacks exploiting iframe vulnerabilities.
28. **DOM Manipulation**: Exploiting weaknesses in client-side code.
29. **Insecure Cookies**: Missing `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, or `SameSite` flags.

### Infrastructure and Server-Side Vulnerabilities
30. **Insecure Deserialization**: Executing arbitrary code during object deserialization.

These attack surfaces are starting points for identifying security vulnerabilities in web applications. They highlight how critical it is for developers to follow secure coding practices and regularly review their systems for potential flaws.
