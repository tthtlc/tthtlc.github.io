In mathematical geometry, several types of geometries are studied, each with unique properties, axioms, and applications. Here are the major types:

### 1. **Euclidean Geometry**
   - **Description**: The most familiar geometry, based on the work of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid.
   - **Properties**: Focuses on flat, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) spaces.
   - **Axioms**: Includes concepts such as points, lines, and angles, with rules like parallel lines never intersecting.
   - **Applications**: Used in everyday measurements, construction, engineering, and classical mechanics.

### 2. **Non-Euclidean Geometry**
   - **Description**: Geometries that deviate from Euclidean axioms, primarily concerning the nature of parallel lines.
   - **Types**:
     - **Hyperbolic Geometry**: Deals with curved spaces where parallel lines diverge (saddle-shaped).
     - **Elliptic Geometry**: Involves curved spaces where parallel lines converge (spherical shapes).
   - **Applications**: Essential in understanding the universe's shape in cosmology, general relativity, and GPS calculations.

### 3. **Projective Geometry**
   - **Description**: Studies properties that remain invariant under projection, focusing on points at infinity.
   - **Properties**: Lines intersect at infinity; parallel lines meet in the projective plane.
   - **Applications**: Used in computer vision, art (perspective drawing), and 3D rendering.

### 4. **Affine Geometry**
   - **Description**: Similar to Euclidean geometry but without the concept of angles or distances.
   - **Properties**: Focuses on parallelism and ratios of distances, but angles and lengths are not preserved.
   - **Applications**: Important in computer graphics and engineering transformations.

### 5. **Differential Geometry**
   - **Description**: Uses calculus and algebra to study curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional manifolds.
   - **Properties**: Investigates properties like curvature and torsion, useful for non-linear shapes.
   - **Applications**: Widely used in physics, especially in general relativity, as well as in robotics and modern geometry.

### 6. **Algebraic Geometry**
   - **Description**: Studies geometries through algebraic expressions, particularly polynomial equations.
   - **Properties**: Considers solutions to polynomial equations as points on curves or surfaces.
   - **Applications**: Crucial in cryptography, number theory, and theoretical physics.

### 7. **Topology (or Topological Geometry)**
   - **Description**: Studies properties that remain constant through continuous deformations, such as stretching or bending, without tearing.
   - **Properties**: Focuses on concepts like continuity, compactness, and connectedness rather than distances.
   - **Applications**: Important in understanding spaces, knots, and networks; widely applied in data analysis, biology, and quantum physics.

### 8. **Riemannian Geometry**
   - **Description**: A branch of differential geometry that deals with curved surfaces.
   - **Properties**: Studies smooth manifolds with a Riemannian metric, allowing the measurement of angles, lengths, and areas.
   - **Applications**: Central to general relativity, where it describes the curvature of spacetime.

### 9. **Discrete Geometry**
   - **Description**: Focuses on geometric structures with distinct, separate elements, like points and lines.
   - **Properties**: Deals with combinatorial properties of geometric objects and shapes.
   - **Applications**: Used in computer science, particularly in algorithms, graph theory, and computational geometry.

### 10. **Fractal Geometry**
   - **Description**: Studies self-similar and infinitely complex patterns, often in fractional dimensions.
   - **Properties**: Shapes are defined recursively, with parts resembling the whole on different scales.
   - **Applications**: Found in nature (e.g., coastlines, mountains), and used in computer graphics, biology, and network modeling.

### 11. **Complex Geometry**
   - **Description**: Studies spaces where coordinates are complex numbers rather than real numbers.
   - **Properties**: Extends concepts of real geometry to complex-number planes.
   - **Applications**: Important in string theory, quantum field theory, and complex analysis.

Each of these geometries serves as a unique lens through which mathematicians and scientists can understand and model different aspects of the physical and theoretical world.
